# Object-Oriented Programming and GUI in Python
This project demonstrates the progression from **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python to the creation of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Tkinter. 

## Project Overview
- **Console Version (OOP)**  
  - Implemented the game *Les GlaDÉateurs* in console mode.  
  - Focused on object-oriented design with classes such as `Dé`, `Joueur`, `Arène`.  
  - Demonstrated encapsulation, inheritance, and modular code structure.  

- **GUI Version (Tkinter)**  
  - Extended the project with a graphical interface.  
  - Implemented widgets (table, buttons, scale) for user interaction.  
  - Added computer players and visual dice rendering.  
  - Practiced event-driven programming.  

##  Repository Structure
- `Console/` → console-based OOP implementation  
- `GUI/` → Tkinter-based GUI implementation  

## Technologies
- Python 3  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Tkinter (GUI toolkit)  
- Event-driven programming
